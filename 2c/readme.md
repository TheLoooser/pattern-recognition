## todo

• Optimize learning rate (typically in the range [0.001, 0.1]).
• Optimize number of training iterations. Plot a graph showing the accuracy on the training
set and the validation set, respectively, with respect to the training epochs.
• Perform the random initialization several times and choose the best network during vali-
dation.

# expected output
• Small report in PDF / README format on the GitHub containing:
    - Plot showing the accuracy and loss on the training and the validation set with respect
to the training epochs.
    - Test accuracy with the best parameters found during validation.
• Indiviual: Manual forward-pass handed in through ILIAS.
